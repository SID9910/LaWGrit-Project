            <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>Article 31A protects five categories of laws from being challenged and invalidated for violating the fundamental rights conferred by Article 14 (equality before the law and equal protection of the laws) and Article 19 (protection of six rights in relation to speech, assembly, movement, and so on).<br><br> It also guarantees the right to compensation in the event that the state acquires or requisitions private property.

            <h3>Meaning of Article 31A</h3>
            <br>
         <p></p>
            <li> In other words, it comprises of the following:</li>
            <br>
           
            <ul>
         <li><span>(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in Article 13, no law providing for –

           <br><br> (a) the acquisition by the State of any estate or of any rights therein or the extinguishment or modification of any such rights, or
            <br><br>(b) the taking over of the management of any property by the State for a limited period either in the public interest or to secure the proper management of the property, or
            <br><br>(c) the amalgamation of two or more corporations either in the public interest or to secure the proper management of any of the corporations, or
            <br><br>(d) the extinguishment or modification of any rights of managing agents, secretaries, and treasurers, managing directors, directors or managers of corporations, or any voting rights of share-holders thereof, or
            <br><br>(e) the extinguishment or modification of any rights accruing by any agreement, lease, or license to search for, or win, any mineral or mineral oil, or the premature termination or cancellation of any such agreement, lease, or license, shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by article 14 or article 19: Provided that where such law is a law made by the Legislature of a State, the provisions of this article shall not apply thereto unless such law, having been reserved for the consideration of the President, has received his assent:
            Provided further that where any law makes any provision for the acquisition by the State of any estate and where any land comprised therein is held by a person under his cultivation, it shall not be lawful for the State to acquire any portion of such land as is within the ceiling limit applicable to him under any law for the time being in force or any building or structure standing thereon or appurtenant thereto, unless the law relating to the acquisition of such land, building or structure, provides for payment of compensation at a rate which shall not be less than the market value thereof.</span></li>
            <br>
        
        <li><span>(2) In this article, –

           <br><br> (a) the expression “estate” shall, about any local area, have the same meaning as that expression or its local equivalent has in the existing law relating to land tenure in force in that area and shall also include –
            
         <br>   (i) any jagir, inam or mafia or other similar grant and in the States of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, any janmam right;
           <br> (ii) any land held under ryotwari settlement;
            <br>(iii) any land held or let for purposes of agriculture or for purposes ancillary thereto, including waste land, forest land, land for pasture or sites of buildings and other structures occupied by cultivators of land, agricultural laborers, and village artisans;
            
            <br><br>(b) the expression “rights”, about an estate, shall include any rights vesting in a proprietor, sub-proprietor, under-proprietor, tenure-holder, raiyat, under-raiyat or other intermediary and any rights or privileges in respect of land revenue.</span></li>
        </ul>
 <p>The Constitution has been updated on its journey to progress, from the First Amendment in 1951 until the 124th Amendment in 2019. The most contentious issue was the right to property, which resulted in various revisions and complaints. 31-A, inserted with display effect by the Constitution First Amendment Act, 1951, provides for the acquisition of estates of the type referred to in various clauses, declaring that such laws shall not be deemed void on the grounds that they deprive any of the rights guaranteed by Articles 14 or 19 of the Constitution.</p>
